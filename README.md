It's some kind of interview question for practice.

TASK:
Given a file named merry-christmas.txt that has a single integer x in it.
Write a script to generate a Christmas tree with asterisks (\*) and output it as happy-holidays.txt.
The tree should have a height of x.
If merry-christmas.txt is empty, the height should be 25 asterisks tall.
